# Tutorial View

Take notebook-view, replace the Dev/New with steps, make it so which tabs are open changes with navigation between steps. Provide a way to open file from a different step for comparison. Ways to do this:

- Allow toggling automatically opening tabs on step navigation
- Provide a menu on a file to open another version of the file
- Provide a menu to open files from any step without navigating away from it
- Provide a way to open another step's markdown in a split view and only have the opened tabs be in the main markdown file - Perhaps at the bottom of the markdown file, "Show another step here"
