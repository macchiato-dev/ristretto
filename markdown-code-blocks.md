# Markdown Code Blocks

This loads content from Markdown code blocks in a transparent manner. To facilitate this:

- All code blocks must be fenced. To simplify Ctrl/Cmd-F, only backquote fences are allowed. (However, it isn't because I have a problem with them â€“ and they will be used for embedding a Markdown document in a JavaScript string so not every backquote needs to be escaped.)
- Code blocks are given names with an inline code block appearing above the fenced code block. This way, the names will be visible in rendered Markdown as well as in the source. They are not hidden in the info strings. There is nothing but inline code blocks in these lines. The first inline code block is the filename, and there can be certain other inline code blocks following this to indicate things such as whether it doesn't end in a newline (`-`) or is binary content as base64 (`b64`). They must have two line breaks between them and the fenced code, which amounts to one empty line.
- Anonymous code blocks are allowed and ignored, but the last non-whitespace character before them must not be a backquote.
- The name can be a JSON string, and if it begins with a `"` it will be parsed as a JSON string. All names that begin with a `"` will be parsed as a JSON string and if parsing fails there will be an error. These inline code blocks can use more than one backquote (needed if a backquote appears in a name - this attempts to be universal).
- The fenced code blocks must all start at the first character. If it finds any that don't, it will refuse to load the file.
- All fenced code blocks must terminate successfully.
- It must not contain `<summary>` or `<details>` outside of fenced code blocks. This is to prevent hiding code blocks in rendered Markdown.
- As mentioned above, there are additional inline code blocks that can be added after the filename:
  - Does not end in newline: `-` This only applies to regular blocks, not `b64` or `str`.
  - Is base64 encoded binary data, that should be converted to binary data: `b64` This can be spread over multiple lines and lines can have trailing whitespace.
  - Is a JSON string or an array of JSON strings: `str` This can be used to include an empty file. If it is an array of JSON strings they will be concatenated.
- Empty code blocks aren't allowed, because they aren't easy to find visually. To make an empty file, put empty quotes (`""`) on a single line in a fenced code block and put `str` after the filename.

Here is the implementation, with an annotation at the end: 

`read-markdown-code-blocks.js`

```js
export function* readMarkdownCodeBlocks(input) {
  const re = /(?:^|\n)([ \t]*)(`{3,}|~{3,})([^\n]*\n)/
  // TODO: look for other ways to have them rendered hidden
  const disallowed = /^    |<^\s*(?:summary|details)/i
  let index = 0
  while (index < input.length) {
    const open = input.substring(index).match(re)
    if (input.substring(index, open).match(disallowed)) {
      throw new Error('<details>, <summary>, and non-fenced code blocks are not allowed')
    }
    if (!open) {
      break
    } else if (open[1].length > 0 || open[2][0] === '~') {
      throw new Error(`Invalid open fence at ${index + open.index}`)

      new RegExp(`\n([ ]{0,3})${open[2]}(\`*)[ \t]*\r?(?:\n|$)`)
    )

      throw new Error(`Missing or invalid close fence at ${index + open.index}`)
    }
    const contentRange = [contentStart, contentStart + close.index]
    const blockRange = [index + open.index, contentRange.at(-1) + close[0].length]
    const nameLineMatch = input.slice(index, block.blockRange[0]).match(
      /(^|\n[^\n*]\n)([ \t]*`[^\n]*|[^\n]*`)(\s*)$/
    )
    if (nameLineMatch) {
      if (
        !nameLineMatch[1].match(/^\s*$/) ||
        nameLineMatch[3].split('').filter(s => s === '\n').length !== 2
      ) {
        throw new Error(
          'The line containing a name of a code block must have at least one empty ' +
          'line before it and exactly one empty line after it'
        )
      }
      let line = nameLineMatch[2]
      const modifierPattern = /\s* `(-|b64|str)`/
      let modifier
      const modifierMatch = line.match(modifierPattern)
      if (modifierMatch) {
        line = line.replace(modifierPattern, '')
        modifier = modifierMatch[1]
      }
      const quotes = `^(\`+)`.match(line)
      const nameMatch = line.match(new RegExp(`^${quotes}(.*)${quotes}$`))
      const quoteMatches = [...line.matchAll(quotes)]
      if (!nameMatch || quoteMatches.length !== 2 || !quoteMatches.every(m => m[0] === quotes)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid name line')
      }
      let name = match[1]
      if (name.slice(0, 1) === ' ' && name.slice(-1) == ' ' && name.length > 2) {
        name = name.slice(1, -1)
      }
      name = name.startsWith('"') ? JSON.parse(name) : name
      yield {
        name,
        blockRange: [blockRange[0] - match[0].length, blockRange[1]],
        contentRange,
        info: open[3].trim(),
        modifier
      }
    }
    index = blockRange.at(-1)
  }
  if (input.substring(index).match(disallowed)) {
    throw new Error('<details>, <summary>, and non-fenced code blocks are not allowed')
  }
}
```

`[annotation]` `5b96d2578b43`

- `2:13-50` This detects any line that start like a fenced code block. It captures the initial characters that aren't allowed. It captures the fence so it can find the closing fence.
- `17-19` This finds the closing fence, based on the opening fence.
- `25-27` This looks for a line containing a name. If there is a line that starts or ends with a backquote, it tries to use it as the name, and if it fails, it outputs an error. An anonymous code block can be preceeded by something that doesn't start or end with a backquote.
- `38-48` Get the line, remove the modifier, get the starting quotes, ensure they just appear twice, and get the name from between the quotes.

## Note about the annotation

The purpose of this annotation is to think through the code out loud, and invite the reader of the notebook to do the same. It doesn't replace comments in the code. Some things are better as comments in the code. Having this does cause a risk of using annotations for something that would be better as a comment, but being that this is a code notebook project, this attempts to provide rich features for notebooks and to use them.

The following declares the annotation with a checksum. It applies to the preceding code block. The checksum is for the content of the preceding code block. It is the first 12 characters of the SHA-1 for the preceding code block. It is used to keep the line and character positions in the annotations from being out-of-date.

The annotations are in an unordered list with each item starting with an inline code block containing the lines/columns for the annotation. The lines and columns are separated with `:`. Redundant lines/columns can be omitted. If there is no row:column pair, both will be lines. If the start is a row:column pair and the last is just one number, it's a column.

## Test cases

This provides some simple test cases. To make this notebook smaller, more test cases may be given outside of this file.

These test cases are provided as exported default functions.

## Test runner

A test runner is given here so it can be run both in Deno and in the browser (through Deno). This will also be runnable using a server.
